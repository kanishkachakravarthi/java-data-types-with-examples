Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
The Non-Primitive (Reference)
Data Types will contain a memory address of variable values because the reference types won’t store the variable value directly in memory. 
They are strings, objects, arrays, etc.
1. Strings
Strings are defined as an array of characters. 
The difference between a character array and a string in Java is, 
that the string is designed to hold a sequence of characters in a single variable whereas, 
a character array is a collection of separate char-type entities. Unlike C/C++, Java strings are not terminated with a null character.

Syntax: Declaring a string
<String_Type> <string_variable> = “<sequence_of_string>”;
